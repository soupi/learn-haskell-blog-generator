# Working with IO

In previous chapters we were able to build a parser from a text
string to a Haskell representation of our markup language,
and we built an EDSL for easy writing of HTML code.
However, our program is still not useful to other users because
we did not make this functionality accessible to a user via some sort of
a user interface.

In our program, we'd like to learn from the user what they'd
like our program to convert to HTML, and then convert that for them.
There are many ways to design this kind of interface, for example:

- Get text as input via the *standard input*, and output HTML
  via the *standard output*
- Receive two file names as *command-line arguments*, read the contents
  of the first one and write the output to the second one
- Ask for some fancier command-line arguments parsing and prefix
  the file with a flag saying what they are
- Some fancy GUI interface
- Combination of all of the above

To make this interesting, we will start with the following interface:

1. If the user calls the program without arguments, we will read from
   the standard input, and write to the standard output
2. If the user calls the program with two arguments, the first one
   will be the input file name which we will read, and the second one
   will be the output file name to which we will write
3. If the output file already exists, we'll ask the user if they want
   to override the file
4. On any other kind of input, we'll output a generic message explaining
   the usage as we described above

At a later chapter, we will add a little fancier command-line interface
using a library, and also read whole directories and not single files.

But first, we need to learn a bit about I/O in Haskell, what makes
it special, and why it's a bit different from other programming languages.

## Purely functional

Originally, Haskell was designed in order to become an *open standard*
functional programming language with **non-strict semantics**, to serve
as a unifying language for future research in functional language design.

In GHC Haskell, we use a *lazy evaluation strategy* to implement non-strict
semantics (We've talked about laziness
[before](https://soupi.github.io/learn-haskell-blog-generator/04-markup/02-parsing_01.html#laziness)).

The requirement for non-strict semantics has raise an interesting challenge,
how do we design a language that can do more than just evaluate expressions,
how do we model interaction with the outside world? How do we do I/O?

The challenge with doing I/O operations in a language with a lazy evaluation strategy
is that as programs grow larger, the order of evaluation becomes less trivial to
figure out. Consider this hypothetical code example
(which won't actually type-check in Haskell, we'll see why soon):

```hs
addWithInput :: Int -> Int
addWithInput n = readIntFromStdin + n

main =
  let
    result1 = addWithInput 1
    result2 = addWithInput 2
  in
    print (result2 - result1)
```

This hypothetical program will read 2 integers from the standard input,
and then will subtract the second one (+2) from the first one (+1),
or so we would expect if this was a strict language. In a strict language
we expect the order of operations to to happen from the top-down.

But in a lazy language we don't actually evaluate an expression until
it is needed, and so neither `result1` nor `result2` are evaluated
until we wish to print the result of subtracting one from the other,
and then when we try to evaluate `-`, it requires to evaluate the two arguments
in order from left to right, so we first evaluate `result2`.

Evaluating `result2`, with substitution, means to replace occurrences of `n`
with the input `2`, and then evaluate the top level function (`+`), it is a
primitive function, we then evaluate its arguments, `readIntFromStdin`
and then `n`, at this point *we are reading the first integer from the stdin*.

After calculating the result, we can move to evaluate `result1`, in which,
during evaluation, *will read the second integer from stdin*, this is the
complete opposite of what we wanted!

Issues like these make lazy evaluation hard to work with in the presence of
**side effects** - when the evaluation of an expression *can affect or be affected
by the outside world*, this includes reading/writing from mutable memory
or performing I/O operations.

We call functions that has side-effects such as `addWithInput` **impure functions**.
And an unfortunate consequence of impure functions is that
**they can return different results even when they takes the same input**.

The presence of impure functions makes it harder for us to reason about lazy evaluation,
and also messes up our ability to use *equational reasoning* to understand programs.

Therefore, for Haskell, it was decided to only allow **pure** functions and expressions - ones that
have *no side effects* - pure functions will *always* return the same output (given the same input)
and **evaluating pure expressions is deterministic**.

But now, how can we do input/output operations? There are many possible solutions
for the design space, in Haskell it was chosen to design a first class interface
with an accompanied type called `IO`. `IO`'s interface will force a distinction
from non-I/O expressions, and will also require that in order to combine
multiple `IO` operations, we will have to determine the order between them.

## IO

`IO` is an opaque type, like our `Html` type in which we hid its internal
representation from the user behind an interface. But in this case `IO` is a
built-in type that is hidden by the Haskell language rather than a module.

`IO` has a payload type like `Maybe` has which represents the
result of an `IO` operation/action/computation.
When there isn't a meaningful result, we use the unit type,
`()` (which only has one value: `()`) to represent that.

Here are a few `IO` operations and functions that return `IO` operations:

```hs
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

getLine :: IO String

getArgs :: IO [String]

lookupEnv :: String -> IO (Maybe String)

writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
```

<!-- You can find more useful IO functions and operations in the
[System.IO](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.15.0.0/docs/System-IO.html) module.
which is shipped with `base`. -->

Notice that each function returns an `IO <something>`, but what does that mean?

The meaning behind `IO a` is that it is a *description of a program (or subroutine)
that when executed will produce some value of type `a`, and may do some I/O effects
during execution*.

Executing an `IO a` is different from evaluating it.
Evaluating an `IO a` expression is pure - the **evaluation** will always reduce to
the same **description** of a program. This helps us keep purity and equational reasoning!

The Haskell runtime will *execute* the entry point to the program
(the expression `main`, that must have the type `IO ()`) in order for our IO operation
to also run it has to be *combined into* the `main` expression - let's see what that means.

## Combining IO expressions

Just like our `Html.Structure` type, the IO interface provides **combinators** for composing
small `IO` operations into bigger ones. This interface also makes sure that the order
of operations is well defined!

Note that, just like with `<>` we've defined for `Html.Structure`, the combinators for `IO`
are implemented as **type-class instances** rather than specialized variants
(for example our `append_` function was a specialized version of `<>` tailored only
for `Structure`).

In this section I will introduce specialized type signatures rather than generalized ones,
because I think it'll be easier to digest, but we'll talk about the generalized versions
later.

### >>=

Our first combinator is `>>=` (pronounced bind), and is the most useful of the bunch:

```hs
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
```

This combinator takes two arguments, the first is an IO operation, and the second is
a function that *takes as input the result of the first IO operation* and returns
a new `IO b` which is the final result.

Here are a few examples using the functions we described above:

1. Echo

   ```
   getLine >>= (\line -> putStrLn line)
   ```
   
   We are reading a line from the standard input on the left of `>>=`,
   and receive the input to the left of `>>=`, and then write it to the
   standard output. `>>=`'s role here is to **pass the result of the IO operation
   on the left to the function returning an IO operation on the right**.
   
   Notice how `>>=` *defines an order of operations - from left to right*.
   
   The type of each sub expression here is:
   
   ```hs
   getLine :: IO String
   
   putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
   
   (>>=) :: IO String -> (String -> IO ()) -> IO ()
   
   line :: String
   ```
   
   - Question: what is the type of the whole expression? <details><summary>Answer</summary>IO ()</details>
   
   Also note that this example above can be written in a more concise manner
   in point free style `getLine >>= putStrLn`.

2. Appending two inputs

   ```
   getLine >>= (\honorific -> getLine >>= (\name -> putStrLn ("Hello " ++ honorific ++ " " ++ name)))
   ```

   This subroutine combines multiple operations together, it reads two lines from
   the standard input and prints a greeting.
   Note that:
     - Using `>>=` defines the order of operation from left to right
     - Because of the scoping rules in Haskell, `honorific` will be in scope
       in the body of the function for which it is its input, including the most inner function

   This is a bit hard to read, but we can remove the parenthesis and add indentation to make it a bit easier to read:

   ```
   getLine >>= \honorific ->
     getLine >>= \name ->
       putStrLn ("Hello " ++ honorific ++ " " ++ name)
   ```

Let's see a few more combinators!

### *> and >>

```hs
(*>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
```

`*>` and `>>` have the same type signature for `IO` and mean the same thing,
in fact, `*>` is a slightly more generalized version of `>>` and can always
be used instead of `>>`, which only still exists to avoid breaking backward
compatibility.

`*>` for `IO` means run the first IO operation, discard the result
then run the second operation. It can be implemented using `>>=`:

```
a *> b = a >>= \_ -> b
```

This combinator is useful when we want to run several `IO` operations one after
the other that might not return anything meaningful, such as `putStrLn`:

```
putStrLn "hello" *> putStrLn "world"
```

### pure and return

```hs
pure :: a -> IO a
```

like `*>` and `>>`, `pure` is a more general version of `return`. `pure` also has the
advantage of not having a resemblance to an unrelated keyword in other languages.

Remember that we said `IO a` is description of a program
that when executed will produce some value of type `a`, and may do some I/O effects
during execution?

With `pure`, we can build an `IO a` that does no I/O, and will produce a
specific value of type `a`, the one we supply to `pure`!

This function is useful when we want to do some uneffectful computation that depends on `IO`.

For example:

```hs
confirm :: IO Bool
confirm =
  putStrLn "Are you sure? (y/n)" *>
    getLine >>= \answer ->
      case answer of
        "y" -> pure True
        "n" -> pure False
        _ ->
          putStrLn "Invalid response. use y or n" *>
            confirm
```

Trying to return just `True` or `False` here wouldn't work because of the
type of `>>=`:

```hs
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
```

The right side of `>>=` in our code example (`\answer -> case ...`) must
be of type `String -> IO Bool` this is because:

1. `getLine :: IO String`, so the `a` in the type signature of `>>=`
   should be the same as `String` in this instance, and
2. `confirm :: IO Bool`, so `b` should be `Bool`

### fmap and <$>

```hs
fmap :: (a -> b) -> IO a -> IO b
```

`<$>` is the infix version of `fmap`. Use it at your discretion.

What if we wanted to write a function that reads a line from stdin
and returns it with `!` at the end? We could write it using a combination
of `>>=` and `pure`:

```
getLine >>= \line -> pure (line ++ "!")
```

The pattern is unified to the `fmap` function:

```
fmap (\line -> line ++ "!") getLine
```

What `fmap` does is apply a function to the value to be returning
from the `IO` operation, also known as "mapping" over it.

(By the way, Have you noticed the similarities between `fmap` and `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`?)

### Summary

Here's a list of `IO` combinators we ran into:

```hs
-- chaining IO operations: passing the *result* of the left IO operation
-- as an argument to the function on the right.
-- Pronounced "bind".
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

-- sequence two IO operations, discarding the payload of the first.
(*>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b

-- "lift" a value into IO context, does not add any I/O effects.
pure :: a -> IO a

-- "map" (or apply a function) over the payload value of an IO operation.
fmap :: (a -> b) -> IO a -> IO b
```

## IO is first class

The beauty of `IO` is that it's a completely first-class construct in the language,
and is not really different from `Maybe`, `Either` or `Structure`. We can pass it to
functions, put it in a container, etc. Remember that it represents a description
of a program, and without combining it into `main` in some way won't actually
*do* anything. It is just a value!

Here's an example of a function that takes IO actions as input:

```hs
whenIO :: IO Bool -> IO () -> IO ()
whenIO cond action =
  cond >>= \result ->
    if result
      then action
      else pure ()
```

And how it can be used:

```hs
main :: IO ()
main =
  putStrLn "This program will tell you a secret" *>
    whenIO confirm (putStrLn "IO is actually pretty awesome") *>
      putStrLn "Bye"
```

Notice how `putStrLn "IO is actually pretty awesome"` isn't executed
right away, but only if it is what `whenIO` returns, and in turn is *combined*
with `*>` as part of the `main` expression.

## Getting out of IO?

What we've seen above has great consequences to the Haskell language,
in our `Html` type, we had a function `render :: Html -> String`
that could turn an `Html` to a string value.

In Haskell, **there is no way** to implement a function such as `execute :: IO a -> a`
in a way that preserves purity and equational reasoning!

Also, `IO` is *opaque*, it does not let us examine it. So we are really bound
to what the Haskell API for `IO` allows us to do.

This means that **we need to think about using IO differently**!

In Haskell, once we got into `IO`, there is no getting out.
The only thing we can do is build bigger IO computations by *combining*
it with more IO computations.

We also can't use `IO a` in place of an `a`, so for example,
we can't write `getLine ++ "!"` because `++` expects both
sides to be Strings, and `getLine`'s type is `IO String`. The types do not match!
We have to use `fmap` and the return type must be `IO String`, like we've seen before.

In Haskell we like to keep `IO` usage minimal, and we like to push it to the edges
of the program. This pattern is often called *Functional core, imperative shell*.

## Functional core, imperative shell

In our blog generator program, we want to read a file, parse it, and convert it to HTML,
and then print the result to the console.

In many programming languages, we might interleave reading from the file with parsing,
and writing to the file with the HTML conversion. But we don't mix these here.
Parsing operates on a `String` value rather than some file handle,
and `Html` is being convert to a `String` rather than being written to the screen directly.

This approach of separating `IO` and pushing it to the edge of the program gives us
a lot of flexibility. These functions without `IO` are easier to test and examine
(because they are guaranteed to have deterministic evaluation!),
and they are more modular and can work in many contexts (reading from stdin,
reading from network socket, writing to an HTTP connection, and more).

This pattern is often a good approach for building Haskell programs. Especially
batch programs.

## Building a blog generator

We'd like to start building a blog generator, and we want to have the following
interface:

1. If the user calls the program without arguments, we will read from
   the standard input, and write to the standard output
2. If the user calls the program with two arguments, the first one
   will be the input file name which we will read, and the second one
   will be the output file name to which we will write
3. If the output file already exists, we'll ask the user if they want
   to override the file
4. On any other kind of input, we'll output a generic message explaining
   the usage as we described above

We are going to need a few functions:

```hs
getArgs :: IO [String] -- get the program arguments

getContents :: IO String -- Read all of the content from stdin

readFile :: FilePath -> IO String -- Read all of the content from a file

writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO () -- Write a string into a file

doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool -- Checks whether a file exists
```

And the following imports:

```hs
import System.Directory (doesFileExist)
import System.Environment (getArgs)
```

We don't need to add the following import because `Prelude` already imports
these functions for us:

```hs
-- imported by Prelude
import System.IO (getContents, readFile, writeFile)
```

         [input, output] ->
           readFile input >>= \content ->

               let
                 writeResult = writeFile output (process input content)
               in
                 if exists
                   then whenIO confirm writeResult
                   else writeResult
   
         -- Any other kind of program arguments
         _ ->
           putStrLn "Usage: runghc Main.hs [-- <input-file> <output-file>]"

   process :: Html.Title -> String -> String
   process title = Html.render . convert title . Markup.parse

   confirm :: IO Bool
   confirm =
     putStrLn "Are you sure? (y/n)" *>
       getLine >>= \answer ->
         case answer of
           "y" -> pure True
           "n" -> pure False
           _ -> putStrLn "Invalid response. use y or n" *>
             confirm
   
   whenIO :: IO Bool -> IO () -> IO ()
   whenIO cond action =
     cond >>= \result ->
       if result
         then action
         else pure ()
   ```
   
   </details>

## Do notation

While using `>>=` to chain `IO` actions is manageable, Haskell provides
an even more convenient syntactic sugar called *do notation*
which emulates imperative programming.

A *do block* starts with the `do` keyword, and continues with one or more
"statements" which can be one of the following:

1. An expression of type `IO ()`, such as:
   - `putStrLn "Hello"`
   - `if True then putStrLn "Yes" else putStrLn "No"`
2. A let block, such as
   - `let x = 1`
   - or multiple let declarations:
     ```hs
     let
       x = 1
       y = 2
     ```
     Note that we do not write the `in` here.
3. A binding `<variable> <- <expresion>`, such as
   ```hs
   line <- getLine
   ```

And the last "statement" must be an expression of type `IO <something>` -
this will be the result type of the do block.

These construct will be translated to:

1. `<expression> *>`,
2. `let ... in` and
3. `<expression> >>= \<variable>`

respectively.

For example:

```hs
greeting :: IO ()
greeting = do
  putStrLn "Tell me your name."
  let greet name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn (greet name)
```

Is just syntactic sugar for:

```hs
greeting :: IO ()
greeting =
  putStrLn "Tell me your name." *>
    let
      greet name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"
    in
      getLine >>= \name ->
        putStrLn (greet name)
```

It's important to note the difference between `let` and `<-` (bind).
`let` is used to give a new name to an expression which will be in scope
for subsequent lines, and `<-` is used to bind the result `a` in an `IO a`
action to a new name which will be in scope for subsequent lines.

    <td>Technically <code><-</code> is not an operator, but just a syntactic sugar for <code>>>=</code> + lambda, where we bind the result of the computation to a variable</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Do notation is very very common and is often preferable to using `>>=` directly.

## Summary

In this chapter we discussed what "purely functional" means,
where the initial motivation for being purely functional came from,
and how Haskell's I/O interface allows us to create descriptions of programs
without breaking purity.

We have also achieved a major milestone. With this chapter, we implemented
enough pieces that we can finally run our program on a single document
and get an HTML rendered result!

> You can view the code we have until now [here](https://github.com/soupi/learn-haskell-blog-generator/tree/code-after-io).

However, our command-line interface is still sub-par. We want to render a blog
with multiple articles, create an index page, and more. We still have more to do
to be able to call our program a blog generator.

Let's keep going!
