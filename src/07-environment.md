# Passing environment variables

We'd like to add some sort of an environment to keep general information on
the blog for various processing. Things like the blog name, stylesheet
location, and so on.

## Environment

We can represent our environment as a record data type and build it from user input.
The user input can be from command-line arguments, a configuration file,
or something else.

```hs
module HsBlog.Env where

data Env
  = Env
    { eBlogName :: String
    , eStylesheetPath :: FilePath
    }
  deriving Show

defaultEnv :: Env
defaultEnv = Env "My Blog" "style.css"
```

After filling this record with the requested information, we can pass it as
input to any function that might need it. This is a simple approach that can definitely
work for small projects. But sometimes when the project gets bigger and many
nested functions need the same information, threading the environment can get
tedious.

There is an alternative solution to threading the environment as input to functions,
and that is using the
[`ReaderT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html#g:2)
type from the `mtl` (or `transformers`) package.

### ReaderT

```hs
newType ReaderT r m a = ReaderT (r -> m a)
```

`ReaderT` is another *monad transformer* like `ExceptT`, which means
that it also has an instance of `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad` and `MonadTrans`.

As we can see in the definition, `ReaderT` is *a newtype* over a function that takes
some value of type `r`, and returns a value of type `m a`. The `r` usually
represents the environment we want to share between different functions that we want to
compose together, and the `m a` represents the underlying result that we return.
The `m` could be any type that implements `Monad` that we are familiar with.
Usually goes well with `IO` or `Identity`, depending if we want to share
an environment between effectful or uneffectful computations.

What `ReaderT` does is *carry* a value of type `r` and passes it around to
other functions when we use the `Applicative` and `Monad` interfaces so that
we don't have to pass the value around manually. And when we want to grab
the `r` and use it, all we have to do is `ask`.

For our case, this means that instead of Passing around `Env`, we can instead
convert our functions to use `ReaderT` - those that are uneffectful and don't use
`IO`, can return `ReaderT Env Identity a`  instead of `a` (or the simplified version, `Reader Env a`),
and those that are effectful can return `ReaderT Env IO a` instead of `IO a`.

Note, as we've said before, `Functor`, `Applicative` and `Monad` all expect the type
that implements their interface to have the kind `* -> *`.
This means that it is `ReaderT r m` which implements these interfaces,
and when we compose functions with `<*>` or `>>=` we replace the `f` or `m`
in their type signature with `ReaderT r m`.

This means that, as with `Either e` when we had composed functions with the same error type,
so it is with `ReaderT r m` - we have to compose functions with the same `r` type and same
`m` type, so we can't mix different environment types or different underlying `m` types.

We're going to use a specialized version of `ReaderT` that uses a specific `m` = `Identity`
called [`Reader`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html#g:2).
The `Control.Monad.Reader` provides an alias: `Reader r a = ReaderT r Identity a`.

> If the idea behind `ReaderT` is still a bit fuzzy to you and you want

### How to use Reader

#### Defining a function

Instead of defining a function like this:

```hs
txtsToRenderedHtml :: Env -> [(FilePath, String)] -> [(FilePath, String)]
```

We define it like this:

```hs
txtsToRenderedHtml :: [(FilePath, String)] -> Reader Env [(FilePath, String)]
```

Now that our code uses `Reader`, we have to accommodate that in the way we write our function:

Before:

```hs
txtsToRenderedHtml :: Env -> [(FilePath, String)] -> [(FilePath, String)]
txtsToRenderedHtml env txtFiles =
 let
   txtOutputFiles = map toOutputMarkupFile txtFiles
   index = ("index.html", buildIndex env txtOutputFiles)
   htmlPages = map (convertFile env) txtOutputFiles
 in
   map (fmap Html.render) (index : htmlPages)
```

Note how we needed to thread the `env` to the other functions that use it.

After:

```hs
txtsToRenderedHtml :: [(FilePath, String)] -> Reader Env [(FilePath, String)]
txtsToRenderedHtml txtFiles = do
  let
    txtOutputFiles = map toOutputMarkupFile txtFiles
  index <- (,) "index.html" <$> buildIndex txtOutputFiles
  htmlPages <- traverse convertFile txtOutputFiles
  pure $ map (fmap Html.render) (index : htmlPages)
```

Note how we use *do notation* now, and *instead of threading* `env` around we *compose*
the relevant functions, `buildIndex` and `convertFile`, we use the type classes
interfaces to compose the functions. Note how we needed to `fmap` over `buildIndex`
to add the output file we needed with the tuple, and how we needed to use `traverse` instead
of `map` to compose the various `Reader` values `convertFile` will produce.

### Extracting `Env`

When we want to use our `Env`, we need to *extract* it from the `Reader`.
We can do it with:

```hs
ask :: ReaderT r m r
```

Which yanks the `r` from the `Reader` - we can extract with `>>=` or `<-` in do notation.
See the comparison:

Before:

```hs
convertFile :: Env -> (FilePath, Markup.Document) -> (FilePath, Html.Html)
convertFile env (file, doc) =
  (file, convert env (takeBaseName file) doc)
```

After:

```hs
convertFile :: (FilePath, Markup.Document) -> Reader Env (FilePath, Html.Html)
convertFile (file, doc) = do
  env <- ask
  pure (file, convert env (takeBaseName file) doc)
```

> Note: we didn't change `convert` to use `Reader` because it is a user facing API for our
> library. By providing a simpler interface we allow more users to use our library -
> even those that aren't yet familiar with monad transformers.
>
> Providing a simple function argument passing interface is preferred in this case.

### Run a `Reader`

Similar to handling the errors with `Either`, at some point we need to supply the environment to
a computation that uses `Reader`, and extract the result from the computation.
We can do that with the functions `runReader` and `runReaderT`:

```hs
runReader :: Reader r a -> (r -> a)

runReaderT :: ReaderT r m a -> (r -> m a)
```

These functions convert a `Reader` or `ReaderT` to a function that takes and `r`.
Then we can pass the initial environment to that function:

```hs
convertDirectory :: Env -> FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
convertDirectory env inputDir outputDir = do
  DirContents filesToProcess filesToCopy <- getDirFilesAndContent inputDir
  createOutputDirectoryOrExit outputDir
  let
    outputHtmls = runReader (txtsToRenderedHtml filesToProcess) env
  copyFiles outputDir filesToCopy
  writeFiles outputDir outputHtmls
  putStrLn "Done."
```

See the `let outputHtmls`part.

### Extra: Transforming `Env` for a particular call

Sometimes we may want to modify the `Env` we pass to a particular function call.
For example, we may have a general `Env` type that contains a lot of information, and
functions that only need a part of that information.

If the functions we are calling are like `convert` and take the environment as an
argument instead of using a `Reader`, we can just extract the environment
with `ask`, apply a function to the extracted environment,
and pass the result to the function, like this:

```hs
outer :: Reader BigEnv MyResult
outer = do
  env <- ask
  pure (inner (extractSmallEnv env))

inner :: SmallEnv -> MyResult
inner = ...

extractSmallEnv :: BigEnv -> SmallEnv
extractSmallEnv = ...
```

But if `inner` uses a `Reader SmallEnv` instead of argument passing,
we can use `runReader` to *convert `inner` to a normal function*,
and use the same idea as above!

```hs
outer :: Reader BigEnv MyResult
outer = do
  env <- ask
  -- Here the type of `runReader inner` is `SmallEnv -> MyResult`
  pure (runReader inner (extractSmallEnv env))

inner :: Reader SmallEnv MyResult
inner = ...

extractSmallEnv :: BigEnv -> SmallEnv
extractSmallEnv = ...
```

This pattern is generalized and captured by a function called
[withReaderT](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.2/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-Reader.html#v:withReaderT),
and works even for `ReaderT`:

```hs
withReaderT :: (env2 -> env1) -> ReaderT env1 m a -> ReaderT env2 m a
```

`withReaderT` takes a function that modifies the environment,
and converts a `ReaderT env1 m a` computation to a `ReaderT env2 m a` computation
using this function.

Let's see it concretely with our example:

```hs
outer :: Reader BigEnv MyResult
outer = withReaderT extractSmallEnv inner
```

---

Question: what is the type of `withReaderT` when specialized in our case?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```hs
withReaderT
  :: (BigEnv -> SmallEnv)     -- This is the type of `extractSmallEnv`
  -> Reader SmallEnv MyResult -- This is the type of `inner`
  -> Reader BigEnv   MyResult -- This is the type of `outer`
```

</details>

---

Note the order of the environments! We use a function from a `BigEnv` to a `SmallEnv`,
to convert a `Reader` of `SmallEnv` to a `Reader` of `BigEnv`!

This is because we are mapping over the *input* of a function rather than the *output*,
and is related to topics like variance and covariance, but isn't terribly important
for us at the moment.

### Using `Env` in our logic code

One thing we haven't talked about yet is actually using our environment in the `convert`
function to generate the pages we want. And actually, we don't even have the ability to add
stylesheets to our HTML EDSL at the moment! We need to go back and extend it. Let's do all
that now:

---

Since stylesheets go in the `head` element, perhaps it's a good idea to create an additional
`newtype` like `Structure` for `head` information? Things like title, stylesheet,
and even meta elements can be composed together just like we did for `Structure`
to build the `head`!

1. Do it now: extend our HTML library to include headings and add 3 functions:
   `title_` for titles, `stylesheet_` for stylesheets, and `meta_` for meta elements
   like [twitter cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards).

### Summary

Which version do you like better? Manually passing arguments, or using `Reader`?

To me, it is not clear that the second version with `Reader` is better than the first
with explicit argument passing in our particular case.

Using `Reader` and `ReaderT` makes our code a little less friendly toward beginners
that are not yet familiar with these concepts and techniques, and we don't see
(in this case) much benefit.

As programs grow larger, techniques like using `Reader` become more attractive to use.
For our relatively small example, using `Reader` might not be appropriate.
I've included it in this book because it is an important technique to have in our
arsenal and I wanted to demonstrate it.

It is important to weigh the benefits and costs of using advanced techniques,
and it's often better to try and get away with simpler techniques if we can.
