# Either with IO?

When we create `IO` actions that may require I/O, we risk running into all kinds of errors.
For example, when we use `writeFile`, we could run out of disk space in the middle of writing,
or the file might be write-protected. While these scenarios aren't super common, they are definitely
possible.

We could've potentially encoded Haskell functions like `readFile` and `writeFile` as `IO` operations
that return `Either`, for example:

```hs
readFile :: FilePath -> IO (Either ReadFileError String)
writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO (Either WriteFileError ())
```

However, there are a couple of issues here; the first is that composing `IO` actions
becomes more difficult. Previously we could write:

```hs
readFile "input.txt" >>= writeFile "output.html"
```

But now the types no longer match - `readFile` will return an `Either ReadFileError String` when executed,
but `writeFile` wants to take a `String` as input. We are forced to handle the error
before calling `writeFile`.

## Composing IO + Either using ExceptT

One way to handle this is by using **monad transformers**. Monad transformers provide a way
to stack monad capabilities on top of one another. They are called transformers because
**they take a type that has an instance of monad as input and return a new type that
implements the monad interface, stacking a new capability on top of it**.

For example, if we want to compose values of a type that is equivalent to `IO (Either Error a)`,
using the monadic interface (the function `>>=`), we can use a monad transformer
called [`ExceptT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.3.1/docs/Control-Monad-Except.html#g:2)
and stack it over `IO`.
Let's see how `ExceptT` is defined:

```hs
newtype ExceptT e m a = ExceptT (m (Either e a))
```

Remember, a `newtype` is a new name for an existing type. And if we substitute
`e` with `Error` and `m` with `IO`, we get exactly `IO (Either Error a)` as we wanted.
And we can convert an `ExceptT Error IO a` into `IO (Either Error a)` using
the function `runExceptT`:

```hs
runExceptT :: ExceptT e m a -> m (Either e a)
```

`ExceptT` implements the monadic interface in a way that combines the capabilities of
`Either`, and whatever `m` it takes. Because `ExceptT e m` has a `Monad` instance,
a specialized version of `>>=` would look like this:

```hs
-- Generalized version
(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

-- Specialized version, replace the `m` above with `ExceptT e m`.
(>>=) :: Monad m => ExceptT e m a -> (a -> ExceptT e m b) -> ExceptT e m b
```

Note that the `m` in the specialized version still needs to be an instance of `Monad`.

---

Unsure how this works? Try to implement `>>=` for `IO (Either Error a)`:

```hs
bindExceptT :: IO (Either Error a) -> (a -> IO (Either Error b)) -> IO (Either Error b)
```

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```hs
bindExceptT :: IO (Either Error a) -> (a -> IO (Either Error b)) -> IO (Either Error b)
bindExceptT mx f = do
  x <- mx -- `x` has the type `Either Error a`
  case x of
    Left err -> pure (Left err)
    Right y -> f y
```

Note that we didn't actually use the implementation details of `Error` or `IO`,
`Error` isn't mentioned at all, and for `IO`, we only used the monadic interface with
the do notation. We could write the same function with a more generalized type signature:

```hs
bindExceptT :: Monad m => m (Either e a) -> (a -> m (Either e b)) -> m (Either e b)
bindExceptT mx f = do
  x <- mx -- `x` has the type `Either e a`
  case x of
    Left err -> pure (Left err)
    Right y -> f y
```

And because `newtype ExceptT e m a = ExceptT (m (Either e a))`, we can just
pack and unpack that `ExceptT` constructor and get:


```hs
bindExceptT :: Monad m => ExceptT e m a -> (a -> ExceptT e m b) -> ExceptT e m b
bindExceptT mx f = ExceptT $ do
  -- `runExceptT mx` has the type `m (Either e a)`
  -- `x` has the type `Either e a`
  x <- runExceptT mx
  case x of
    Left err -> pure (Left err)
    Right y -> runExceptT (f y)
```

</details>

`ExceptT` can enjoy both worlds - we can return error values using the function `throwError`:

```hs
throwError :: e -> ExceptT e m a
```

and we can "lift" functions that return a value of the underlying monadic type `m` to return
a value of `ExceptT e m a` instead:

```hs
lift :: m a -> ExceptT e m a
```

for example:

```hs
getLine :: IO String

lift getLine :: ExceptT e IO String
```

> Actually, `lift` is also a type class function from `MonadTrans`, the type class
> of monad transformers. So technically, `lift getLine :: MonadTrans t => t IO String`,
> but we are specializing for concreteness.


Now, if we had:

```hs
readFile :: FilePath -> ExceptT IOError IO String

writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> ExceptT IOError IO ()
```

We could compose them again without issue:

```hs
readFile "input.txt" >>= writeFile "output.html"
```

But remember - the error type `e` (in both the case `Either` and `Except`)
must be the same between composed functions! This means that the type representing
errors for both `readFile` and `writeFile` must be the same - that would also
force anyone using these functions to handle these errors - should a user who
called `writeFile` be required to handle a "file not found" error? Should a user
who called `readFile` be required to handle an "out of disk space" error?
There are many, many more possible IO errors! "network unreachable", "out of memory",
"cancelled thread", we cannot require a user to handle all these errors, or
even cover them all in a data type.

So what do we do?

We give up on this approach **for IO code**, and use a different one: Exceptions,
as we'll see in the next chapter.
